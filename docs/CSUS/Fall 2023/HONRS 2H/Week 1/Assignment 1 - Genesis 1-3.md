The Story of Creation & Adam and Eve


# Overview

There are at least three distinct evolution of the Pentateuch: Monarchical Scribes (Pre Exilic) -> added to by Exilic scribes addressing Judeans exiled in Babylon -> Priests (Exilic and PostExilic) giving it a proper priestly order and themes ->  Combined into a common Torah [*Oxford NSRV Bible*]

"The historicity of Genesis was not a significant concern prior to modern times; historically, it was read metaphorically or allegorically" [*Oxford NSRV Bible*]
# Genesis Chp 1 to Chp 2:4

### Day 1
God created the heavens and the Earth, which was a formless void in darkness. There was, however, water. God said let there be light, and separated light from dark, creating Day and Night.
### Day 2
God made a dome (the Sky), separating waters under it and above it.
### Day 3
The waters below were gathered into the Seas and the dry land became earth. On this earth, vegetation was added.
### Day 4
God put lights in the Sky. The greater light ruled the day, and the lesser the night. Alongside the night light, stars were added.
### Day 5
God created great sea monsters, every living creature that moves in the seas, and birds. They multiplied in the seas and earth.
### Day 6
Earthly creatures on land (cattle, creeping things, and wild animals). Man was created in his image and likeness and given dominion over all creatures. Man was created as male and female. "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it."
### Day 7
God rested.

# Genesis Chp 2:4 to Chp 3:24

This version starts from the day that the Lord made the heavens and the earth. At this time, there were no plants or herbs because there was no rain and no one to till the ground. However, for the garden of Eden (suspected to relate to other mythological tales of things beginning from a "source of creation"), were were streams from the earth that sprayed on the land.

On this day, God took dust from the earth, fashioned it, and put the Breath of Life through its nostrils, creating Man. God planted the garden and placed Man there, were there were trees of every kind, Good for Sight and Good for food. There was the tree of life and tree of knowledge (of good and evil) in the middle of the garden. Man is allowed to eat all but the fruit of the tree of knowledge.

There is a river flowing from the garden, which splits into four branches:
- Pishon, that flows into the land of Havilan (most likely in Arabia) [*Oxford NSRV Bible*]
- Gihon into Cush (Ethiopia or Arabia) [*Oxford NSRV Bible*]
- Tigris
- Euphrates

To make a companion for man, God created every creature and Man named them, but none were suitable companions. So, God put man into deep sleep, took one of his ribs and made Woman, which Man named because she was of man. Man and women become one in flesh. Both were naked, and both were unashamed.

(BEGIN CHAPTER 3)
The serpent was the craftiest of the wild animals. He told woman that god doesn't want you to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge because God knows if you eat it, your eyes will open and you will be like God (you won't die if you touch it). The Woman "Say the tree was good for food, delight to the eyes, and to be desired to make one wise," so both ate the fruit. Their eyes were opened, they saw they were naked, and made fig leaf loincloths.

When god came for a stroll and called to man, they hid. Man explained that he was afraid because he was naked. From this idea of nakedness, god understood they ate the fruit. Man blamed woman, and she the serpent.

The serpent was cursed:
- to go on belly and eat dust
- have their offspring be enemies of women's: they will step on your head and you strike his heel

The woman:
- increase pangs in childbearing
- bring forth children in pain
- desire for husband
- he will rule over you

The man:
- need to toil all days of life to eat from the ground he has cursed
- the ground will bring thorns and thistles for you
- he is of dust, and one day will return to dust (no longer immortal)

The woman was called Eve, for she was the mother of all living things. The Lord made garments of skin for both, and promptly kicked them out, because they now know good and evil, so they cannot be allowed to eat from the tree of life. In the east of the garden, god placed Cherubim, powerful winged creatures, and a sword, flaming and turning, to guard the way to the tree of life.

# Discussion Q's

1) Drawing from the list of “Main Themes and Issues” set forth on the first page of our syllabus, identify which themes or issues seem relevant for Genesis 1-3. To what extent do these themes still seem relevant today?  

Cosmology: The place of humankind within the world. 

Theology: The nature of the divine and its relation to humankind.

The human condition and mortality. 

2) Compare Genesis 1:1-2:4 with Genesis 2:4-3:24 with regard to the process and sequence of creation.

Genesis 1:1-2:4 consider a day-wise flow of creation, in which God does not directly "create" but commands or says (and so it happens). Genesis 2:4-3:24 cover a different series of steps (i.e., man comes first) and show God to be directly creating. This story shows a more co-worker style relation between God and Man, up until Man falls from grace.
