#### What is a treatise? 

A treatise is "a formal piece of writing that considers and examines a particular subject" (Cambridge Dictionary).
# 1. On the State of Nature

In nature, every man is perfectly free in action, to use themselves and possessions as they see fit in the bounds of Nature. It is from this freedom that political power is derived (which will be expounded upon in this treatise).

Firstly, there is equality in nature: all power and jurisdiction is reciprocal and no one has more than another. What one has right to do, so must others. That man is only set above others whom the Lord themselves have given undoubted right of dominion and sovereignty.

In Nature, there is a state of Liberty, not License. In other words, man does not have the liberty to harm himself or others. All are bound by these laws of nature, which is called ***reason***: no one shall hurt any other's life, healthy, liberty, or property.

In this vein, no one has the right to subjugate another. The only time where life may be taken, or impaired, is in case of justice; even then, the justice must be reciprocal and proportional to the violation.

This justice, everyone has the power to execute, to the extent that it hinders violations, for the peace and preservation of all mankind. It is necessary, that under nature, when one has the power, so must others. So, all have this power.

"What any may do in prosecution of that law, everyone must needs have a right to do so."

This retribution must be undertaken from calm reason and conscience, and NOT passion or boundless extravagance.

Such is the state of a ***commonwealth***, the concept of organized political community, as well. 

These laws of Nature ,while exist, are not expounded upon in this treatise.

# 2. Of the Ends of Political Society and Government

If man is made so free, why does he part with that freedom? Because the enjoyment of freedom is tumultuous, uncertain and exposed to invasion by others. So, he is willing to join society for the mutual preservation of lives, liberties, and property.

The central focus of a Commonwealth is the preservation of property.

There are three defects of Nature that stem from man's own interaction with it.

1. There is want for established, settled, and known law allowed by common consent to set right from wrong and as a common tool to. end disputes. The law of Nature is plain to all, but people are biased by their own self interest.
2.  There is want for known and indifferent judge(s). Men are too partial and driven by passion/revenge in their own affairs and thoroughly negligent and unconcerned in others.
3. There is want for power to back and support sentences, with right and due execution. 

[Addition] In summary, these can be seen as the three branches of government: Legislative, Judicial, and Executive.

Man has two powers in the State of Nature:
1. To do as he sees fit within the bounds of Natural Law
2. Punish crime 

From these shortcomings in Nature, that are not so but due to man's own failings, man is quickly driven to society, the ability to take sanctuary under a government's laws appealing enough for man to give up his power to punish alone to the community and/or those appointed by it, and his power to do however he wish for the laws of society. For, if there were no corrupt and viciousness of degenerate men, there would be no need to associate with others.

Thus, man enjoys of the conveniences of labor, assistance, and the society of others in exchange for natural liberty.

"The power of the society or legislative constituted by them can never be supposed to extend further than the common against those three defects above mentioned that made the state of Nature so unsafe and easy."

# 3. Of the Extent of Legislative Power

The greater end of entering society is the enjoyment of property in peace and safety, the instrument of which is the law of society.

The first fundamental law of all commonwealths is established legislative power. The legislative is given the sole and unalterable power; no one else can make the law because they lack the *fundamental component* of law: consent of the society.

Legislative is bound by society, the laws of god and nature in all commonwealth:

1. Legislative is to govern by established law without making exceptions. The law is the same for the rich and poor, those favored by the halls of power and the common worker.
2. Laws ought to be designed for nothing other than the good of the people.
3. Taxes must not be raised w/o consent.
4. Legislative cannot and must not transfer lawmaking power anywhere else.

*These properly only concern governments where legislative is always in being or it has not been deputized


# 4. Dissolution of Government

The constitution is the first and fundamental act of society, where provisions for the preservation of the union through laws and appointment of those in powers to make those laws.

Anyone w/o authority or appointment are not binding to the people. The people have the full liberty to resisted those who impose on them, come out of the subjugation of government, and create a new one: anyone using force w/o right put themselves at war against those they force upon. 

All former ties are canceled, all other rights cease, everyone has a right to defend themselves, and resist the aggressors.

Who decides what is unjust? The people who appoint those rulers decide if they are acting beyond their mandate. 

However, power given up when entering society can never be reversed to individuals: it must remain in the community.
